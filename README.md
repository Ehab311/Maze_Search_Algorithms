2.	Breadth-First Search (BFS)
3.	Bidirectional Search
4.	Depth-First Search with Depth Limit
5.	Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)
6.	Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
7.	Dijkstra's Algorithm
8.	A Search with Euclidean Heuristic*
9.	A Search with Manhattan Heuristic
10. Greedy Search with Euclidean Heuristic
11. Greedy Search with Manhattan Heuristic
